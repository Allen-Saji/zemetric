I can think of three functions here
1. connnect(device, consumption)
2. disconnect(device)
3. allocate_power(device, consumption)
4. reallocate_consumption(device, consumption_change)

MAX_POWER_CAPACITY = 92
MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION = 40
current_consumption = 0
device_list<device, consumption> = {}  //devices that are currently in use


connect(device, consumption) {
    if device is in queue {
        return device is already connected
    }
    power_allocated = allocate_power(device, consumption)
    device_list.add(device, power_allocated)
    return
}

disconnect(device) {
    if device not found in device_list{
        return device not found
    }

    current_consumption -= device consumption
    device_list.remove(device)

    //relallocate the freed up resources in FIFO order
    iterate through device_list
    while (current_consumption == MAX_POWER_CAPACITY || i = device_list.length() - 1) {
        if(device_list[i].power < MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION) {
            device_list[i].power += (MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION - device_list[i].power)
            current_consumption += (MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION - device_list[i].power)
            i++
        }
    }
}

allocate_power(device, consumption) {
    available_power = MAX_POWER_CAPACITY - current_consumption //>=0
    power_allocated = MIN(available_power, consumption)
    current_consumption += power_allocated
    return power_allocated
}

reallocate_consumption(device, consumption_change) { 
    //consumption_change = old consumption - new consumption (so can be -ve or +ve) 
    if device not found in device_list {
        return device not found
    }

    if (consumption_change < 0) { //device needs more power
        allocate_power(device, new consumption)
        return
    }

    if (consumption_change > 0) { //device power consumption dropped
        current_consumption -= device consumption
        allocate_power(device, new consumption)
    }

    //relallocate the freed up resources in FIFO order
    iterate through device_list
    while (current_consumption == MAX_POWER_CAPACITY || i = device_list.length() - 1) {
        if(device_list[i].power < MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION) {
            device_list[i].power += (MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION - device_list[i].power)
            current_consumption += (MAX_DEVICE_C0NSUMPTION - device_list[i].power)
            i++
        }
    }


}


I didn't really test this by writing real code, but I feel like I have covered most cases :)
